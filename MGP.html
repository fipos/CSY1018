    PAGE 5: Models of Good Practice (MGP) in User Interface (UI) Design
    You will demonstrate your knowledge of ‘current’ UI design practices. You are encouraged to work with others on the design aspects of this assignment. Do not work out of your head. You must find sites that are current as models. Make sure to design from Mobile up to desktop as more than 60% of users use mobile over desktop computers.

    You will provide links and screenshots of pages that were influential in your interface design decisions.


    Write at least 200 words minimum explaining your choices and the ways you worked with your team to decide on the best design and the process you used to improve it over time. Sketches may be included.
