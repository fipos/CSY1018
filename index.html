        <h1>Tinuke</h1>
        <p>My name is Tinuke Olukoya, I am a Business Computing student at the
        of Northampton University. I started my academic career back in the day
        studying Hospitality management in Dublin. However, I had to take a
        break when nature called for me to become a mother of two boys. I later
        went back to work in the Hospitality department of the prestigious Naas
        General in the Republic of Ireland. I later moved down to the United
        Kingdom where I decided to live in Milton Keynes due to the growing
        rate of young professional. This also changed my understanding of
        changing my career from hospitality to information technology area of
        business. This gave me an opportunity to work with the NHS as a flow
        walker and a Lorenzo professional. I was later encouraged by some of my
        friends to develop myself in this line of the job by going back to the
        University to get a degree in Business Computing due to my commitment
        and passion. The intrinsic motivation in me gave me the strong will and
        passion for taking that clear step of going back to the University to
        get this degree.</p>
