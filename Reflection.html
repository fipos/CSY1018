  <p>looking back at when I started this programme at the tail end of last year
  (2017). Everything that was being taught in class was really not sticking but
  thanks to the passion I have got burning in me and the support I have
  received from my lecturers has enhanced the drive to spend more time on my
  course assignments and other related academic work. This module has not only
  added to me as a person but has also changed my sense of reasoning. Since I
  started this module, I have realised that my dream as a business computing
  analyst can be achieved if I am able to give a significant amount of
  commitment to my school work. The web development module has given me the
  opportunity to be able to design, develop and maintain a web site. It has
  also given me a broader knowledge and understanding of what a quality and
  insightful web site looks like. I have also imbibed in myself the knowledge
  that, a lot of successful organisation has benefited enormously from the
  output of their organisational web page. This has also enhanced the
  relationship and communication between these organisations and their
  prospective customers. This has also supported the level of organisational
  productive and profitability which believe I will be part of someday. I will
  really want to develop some additional knowledge and skills in this area of
  my programme.</p>
